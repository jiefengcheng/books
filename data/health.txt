 I do not recommend that you run your next half-marathon barefoot.  But certainly, I predict that sooner or later, changes will come about in both shoe design and training.  From the medical establishment's point of view, the prevention and treatment of running injuries must change to incorporate the concepts outlined above.  In fact I view the ideas I've presented here as a major paradigm shift in sports medicine, the likes of which I have not seen in the last fifteen years.  Of course, the major shoe companies have to own up and start introducing better shoes into their lines.
